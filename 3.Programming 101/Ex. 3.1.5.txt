Ex. 3.1.5 (*) 											
Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.											
The program should ask the user if they want to add or subtract two numbers. Then the program should ask											
for the two numbers and print the result.											
											
//Prompt the user to input first number											
PRINT:"Please enter the first number"											
											
//Capture the first number that was given by user and store it											
INPUT firstNumber											
											
//Prompt the user to input second number											
PRINT:"Please enter the second number"											
											
//Capture the second number that was given by user and store it											
INPUT secondNumber											
											
//Ask to the user what s/he want.											
PRINT "Do you want to add or substract ? If you want to add please enter "a" . If you want to substract please enter "s"											
											
INPUT userInput											
											
//If user enter "a"  ,add two number and assign to other value  aResult											
aResult =firstNumber+secondNumber											
PRINT aResult  											
//If user enter "s"  ,substract two number and assign to other value bResult											
bResult =firstNumber-secondNumber											
PRINT aResult  											
//Print the solution on board
