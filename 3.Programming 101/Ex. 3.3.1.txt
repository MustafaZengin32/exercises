Sorting algorithms				
Write a sort algorithm yourself. (e.g. bubble sort)				
				
//Prompt the user to input how many numbers s/he want to enter				
PRINT:"How many numbers do you want to enter to create a list"				
				
//After you defined the length of list , you capture the values 				
INPUT first , second , thirth…				
				
//Define a valuable that program can understand that our list is sorted , if not repeat again from the beginning				
				
//Start with first member of list and compare with second				
				
//If first is bigger than second , it must be swapped 				
				
//Repeat this process until the end of the list with pairs ( index,index+1 | index+1,index+2 | index+2,index+3…)				
				
//At the end , program should control whether list is sorted or not , if not , repeat this proccess again
